This is the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. At this point, the swells vary from eight to fifteen feet, with the largest waves rolling in almost always on the West Coast.

     Though there is a chance of storms and rain accompanying the swells, surfers often find the best breakers during these months.

     From October to April, the waters become gentler and also the waves retreat to normal. Occasionally, bigger swells are created on both the coasts by small storm systems. This is the small swell season (also the peak traveller season) and it’s the most effective time for beginners learn to surfing in India.
